Mobile Application Development Course Project

#Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
#This application aimed to be a simple and easy to use event planner for those who need help keeping their schedule on track.  This app was designed to be the simplest way to set reminders for upcoming events.
#What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs #successful?
There needed to be three main screens, user login, home display, and the notifications screen.  These features will statisfy all of the user's aforementioned needs and remove all unnecessary screens or features other applications may have.
#How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
#I break down the functions and requirements of the application into managable steps that can be handled and focused on without worrying about the entirity of the project.
#How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
#I used the Andoid Studio device emulator to test the functionality of my code.  This process is important because it tests the practicality of the code you have written and #reveals what you may need to change and innovate to make functions work in a practical setting rather than theoretically when writing code.
#Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
#I had to innovate in the design and implementation of a database.  
#In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
#I think designing the layout of my application was where I showed the most knowledge and experience. I was able to use different layouts such as the vertical layout, and create a #simple user interface for the target audience.
